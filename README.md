# GoldBadgeConsoleAppChallenges
This solution is a collection of challenges I (tried to) complete to finish Gold Badge at EFA.

Challenge 1 is a console app so the manager of Komodo Cafe can create new menu items, delete menu items, and receive a list of all items on the cafe's menu.
  She did not require functunatlity to update a menu item this go around.
  
Challenge 2 is a console app for insurers to manage their claims queue.
  Nuff said.

Challenge 2 is a console app for security personnel to assign security badges that have access to specific doors. 
  User also has options to add or remove doors from specific badges, as well as view a list of the badge numbers and the doors they have access to.
